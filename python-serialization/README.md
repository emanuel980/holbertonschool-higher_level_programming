# Python Serialization Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates various serialization techniques in Python, including using JSON, Pickle, and other formats to serialize and deserialize data.

## Features
- Serialize data to JSON format
- Deserialize JSON data
- Serialize data using Pickle
- Deserialize Pickle data

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-serialization-project.git
   cd python-serialization-project
   ```

2. **(Optional) Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Run the main script to see serialization in action:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Examples
### JSON Serialization
```python
import json

data = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}
with open('data.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(data, f)

with open('data.json', 'r') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
```

### Pickle Serialization
```python
import pickle

data = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}
with open('data.pkl', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(data, f)

with open('data.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    data = pickle.load(f)
```
